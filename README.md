# WorkdayPlanner

## HTML

I added time-blocks from 9am to 5pm for the workday schedule
created rows with colomns for each of the 8 working hours
after working with tutor updated each id from "timeAM/PM to hour-"time"
in the text area i added to the class with "description" and set it to localstorage so user can type in and save.  once the page is refreshed the info stays there

## javascript

i started with adding the time function of retrieving the current date and time when looking at the page.
created a time variable so i could track what time it is to see if it syncs up with the page.
created a function to track the time and see if it was either past, present, or future with the hours on the time block.
I was working with my tutor and the js link stopped working.  Created a second java script code and will link it and update it to main js
added save button to save for each hour so that it won't break code all over the place
added document ready function for the whole js
for some reason there appeared to be a linking problem between my html and my original javascript file so i created a new one and copy pasted most of the code from the original.  i deleted the file and renamed the script2 to just script.js
